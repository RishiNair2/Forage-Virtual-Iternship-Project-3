# Forage-Virtual-Iternship-Project-3

This project from Forage was based on a fictional company called Chips. Chips wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

The objective that Chips has set for the data analytics team is to derive insights that will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

The analytics team is tasked with:
- Look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from.
- Derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment.
- Consider the monthly sales experience of each store. 
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
- Merging of sample data set tables.
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel

Main Datasets Analyzed:
- Purchase_Behavior
- Transaction_Data
- Grocery_Data (View that I created to analyze columns from the dataset into one big table)
